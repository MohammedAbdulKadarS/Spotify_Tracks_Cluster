# Spotify_Tracks_Cluster
Spotify Tracks Cluster is a Streamlit web app that uses KMeans clustering to group songs based on their features. Users can select any two music features, give the values, and predict which cluster or mood their input matches. This project is built with Python, scikit-learn, pandas, joblib, and Streamlit.
